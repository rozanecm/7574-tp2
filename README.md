# README
All code is in `src/` dir.

To run, `cd` to `src/` and run `./run.sh`. To stop execution, run `./stop.sh` (from another console, since the first one will be logging).

Compressed files downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/pablodroca/yelp-review-analysis) should be kept in `data/`.
